# determinant of a matrix / Calculating inner brackets' sum
 The first project of the "Data Structures" course \
 This project has two parts. The first is dedicated to recursively calculating the determinant of an input matrix (n * n), and the second is dedicated to calculating the sum of brackets which are recursively calculated.
